# Variables and Context Reference

Every markov workflow execution operates on a **context** -- a `map[string]any` that holds all variables available during runtime. Templates, conditions, and expressions all resolve against this context.

## Context Build Order

The initial context is constructed by `buildContext` (in `engine.go:1136`) in this priority order (later entries override earlier ones):

| Priority | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (lowest) | Global `vars` | File-level `vars:` block at the top of the workflow file |
| 2 | Workflow `vars` | The `vars:` block on the specific workflow being run (non-nil values only) |
| 3 (highest) | CLI `--var` overrides | Variables passed via `--var key=value` on the command line |

**Important:** Nil values in workflow `vars` are treated as parameter declarations, not overrides. They signal that the workflow accepts a parameter but do not clear any existing value from global vars.

```yaml
# File-level vars (priority 1)
vars:
  environment: "dev"
  retries: 3

workflows:
  - name: deploy
    # Workflow vars (priority 2)
    # "target" is nil -- declares a parameter without setting a default
    # "environment" overrides the global value
    vars:
      target:
      environment: "staging"
    steps: [...]
```

```bash
# CLI override (priority 3) -- wins over both global and workflow vars
markov run workflow.yaml --var environment=prod
```

## Setting Variables at Runtime

There are three mechanisms for setting context variables during execution.

### set_fact

A `set_fact` step computes values and merges them directly into the context.

```yaml
- name: compute_labels
  type: set_fact
  vars:
    full_name: "{{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}"
    is_ready: "{{ count > 0 }}"
    config: "{{ raw_json | fromjson }}"
```

Each fact is set into the context **immediately**, so later facts in the same `set_fact` step can reference earlier ones:

```yaml
- name: chained_facts
  type: set_fact
  vars:
    base_url: "https://{{ host }}:{{ port }}"
    health_endpoint: "{{ base_url }}/healthz"  # uses base_url set above
```

### register

The `register` field on a step stores the step's output into the context under the given key.

```yaml
- name: check_api
  type: http_request
  register: api_result
  params:
    url: "https://api.example.com/status"

- name: use_result
  type: shell_exec
  params:
    command: "echo {{ api_result.body }}"
```

### Gate set_fact

Rules in a `gate` step can include `set_fact` maps. When a rule fires, its facts are set via the FactStore and then merged back into the runtime context.

## Variable Scoping

### Sub-workflow isolation

Sub-workflows receive a **copy** of the parent context plus their own vars. Changes made inside a sub-workflow do **not** propagate back to the parent.

```yaml
# Parent workflow
- name: run_child
  workflow: child_workflow
  vars:
    input_data: "{{ some_value }}"
  register: child_output   # only way to get data back

# In child_workflow: modifications to context stay local
# Parent only sees what's in ctx["child_output"]
```

The only way to pass data back from a sub-workflow to the parent is via `register`, which stores the sub-workflow's entire final context map.

### for_each isolation

Each iteration of a `for_each` gets its own copy of the context with the current item set at `ctx[as]`. Iterations run concurrently and do not share state.

If `register` is set on a `for_each` step, it stores a **list of all iteration contexts** (one map per iteration).

## Sub-Workflow Var Merging

The context for a sub-workflow is built by `executeSubWorkflow` (in `engine.go:704`) in this order:

| Step | Operation |
|---|---|
| 1 | Copy all key-value pairs from the parent context |
| 2 | Merge the sub-workflow's own `vars:` block (non-nil values only) |
| 3 | If the step has `vars:`, template-render them against the **parent** context, then merge (string values are coerced) |

```yaml
- name: invoke_analysis
  workflow: analyze
  vars:
    target: "{{ item.name }}"     # rendered against parent context
    threshold: "{{ min_score }}"  # rendered against parent context
```

String values from step-level vars are passed through `coerceString` after rendering, so `"42"` becomes `int(42)`, `"true"` becomes `bool(true)`, etc. Non-string values are stored directly.

## register Behavior

What gets stored by `register` depends on the step type:

| Step Type | Stored Value |
|---|---|
| `shell_exec` | The executor's `Result.Output` map (typically contains `stdout`, `stderr`, `rc`) |
| `k8s_job` | The executor's `Result.Output` map (contains job output) |
| `http_request` | The executor's `Result.Output` map (typically contains `body`, `status_code`, `headers`) |
| Sub-workflow (`workflow:`) | The entire sub-workflow context map (all vars at end of execution) |
| `for_each` | A list (`[]map[string]any`) of all iteration contexts |

## set_fact Evaluation

Each variable value in a `set_fact` step is evaluated by `evalFact` (in `facts.go:25`). The evaluation path depends on the value type:

| Value Pattern | Evaluation Path |
|---|---|
| String containing `{{` or `{%` | Template-rendered, then result is coerced via `coerceString` |
| String matching `{{ path \| fromjson }}` exactly | Direct context path resolution + JSON parse (preserves structure) |
| Plain string (no template delimiters) | Evaluated as boolean expression via `EvalBool` |
| Map with `"from"` key | Table lookup (see Lookup Syntax below) |
| Anything else (numbers, bools, lists, maps) | Stored directly without modification |

### Evaluation order within a single set_fact

Facts are set into the context one at a time, in the order they appear. Each fact can reference any fact that was set before it in the same step.

## Lookup Syntax

The lookup mechanism (from `lookupFact` in `facts.go:64`) performs a table-style query against a list of maps in the context.

```yaml
- name: find_owner
  type: set_fact
  vars:
    owner_name:
      from: "team_members"           # context path to a list of maps
      match:                          # all criteria must match (AND logic)
        department: "engineering"
        status: "{{ current_status }}"  # template values work in match
      field: "name"                   # extract this field from matched row
      default: "unknown"             # fallback if no match found
```

### Lookup fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `from` | Yes | Dot-separated context path to a list of maps |
| `match` | Yes | Map of field-name to expected-value pairs. All must match (AND). Values are compared as strings via `fmt.Sprintf("%v", ...)`. Template expressions are rendered before comparison. |
| `field` | No | If specified, returns only this field from the matched row. If omitted, returns the entire matched row as a map. |
| `default` | No | Returned if the source list is nil or no rows match. If omitted and no match, returns nil. |

### How from resolves

The `from` value is resolved via dot-path context lookup. For example, `"load_data.artifacts.users.rows"` walks through `ctx["load_data"]["artifacts"]["users"]["rows"]`.

### Match behavior

- The source must be a list (`[]any` or `[]map[string]any`). Non-list sources cause an error.
- Items that are not maps are silently skipped.
- All match criteria must be satisfied for a row to match.
- Comparison is string-based: both the row value and the match value are converted via `fmt.Sprintf("%v", val)`.
- Only the **first** matching row is returned.

## Accessing Step Results

After a step completes and its output is registered, you can access it through the context.

```yaml
# Shell command output
- name: get_version
  type: shell_exec
  register: version_check
  params:
    command: "cat VERSION"

- name: use_version
  type: set_fact
  vars:
    version: "{{ version_check.stdout }}"

# HTTP response
- name: fetch_config
  type: http_request
  register: config_response
  params:
    url: "https://api.example.com/config"

- name: parse_config
  type: set_fact
  vars:
    config: "{{ config_response.body | fromjson }}"

# Artifact data (loaded via load_artifact or step artifacts)
- name: load_data
  type: load_artifact
  artifacts:
    inventory:
      path: "data/inventory.yaml"
      format: yaml

- name: use_artifact
  type: set_fact
  vars:
    first_item: "{{ load_data.artifacts.inventory.0 }}"
```

## Context Path Resolution

The `resolveContextPath` function (in `engine.go:1017`) resolves dot-separated paths through nested maps.

```
"a.b.c"  -->  ctx["a"]["b"]["c"]
```

- Each segment is used as a map key lookup.
- If any segment does not exist or the intermediate value is not a map, resolution returns `nil`.
- Array index access is **not** supported in path resolution (use template syntax `{{ list.0 }}` instead, which is handled by pongo2).

This function is used internally for `for_each` list resolution, `from` paths in lookup facts, and the `fromjson` direct resolution shortcut.
